# Host-Based Attacks – Notes

## Introduction
Host-based attacks target a specific system or host running a specific operating system, such as **Windows** or **Linux**.  
They require deeper OS-specific knowledge than network-based attacks.

## Key Concepts

### What Are Host-Based Attacks?
- Exploiting **vulnerabilities** or **misconfigurations** in the operating system.
- Can occur **after** gaining initial access to a network.
- Often used to compromise servers, workstations, or laptops inside the internal network.

### Difference from Network-Based Attacks
- Network-based attacks target **services over the network**.
- Host-based attacks exploit the OS itself or local services.
- Internal systems may not be reachable directly from the internet — attackers often pivot through a compromised host.

## Typical Scenarios
1. **Public Server Exploitation**  
   - Example: Exploiting SSH, FTP, web, or MySQL on a public-facing server.  
   - After access, discover it’s part of a larger **internal network**.

2. **Internal Network Targets**  
   - Machines may not run obvious public services.
   - Often employee workstations (Windows or Linux).

3. **OS Vulnerability Focus**  
   - Exploiting services like **SMB** on Windows.
   - Exploiting limited services like SSH on Linux.

## Skills Required
- Knowledge of **version-specific vulnerabilities** for Windows & Linux.
- Ability to perform:
  - Kernel exploitation
  - Privilege escalation
  - Impersonation attacks
  - Exploitation of misconfigurations

---

## Post-Exploitation Goals
- **Privilege Escalation**: Gain admin or root rights.
- **Credential Dumping**:
  - Cleartext passwords
  - Hashes (NTLM, etc.)
- **Lateral Movement**:
  - Using techniques like Pass-the-Hash to move through the network.

---

## Importance of OS Knowledge
- Without knowledge of OS vulnerabilities, exploitation options are limited.
- With proper knowledge, attackers can:
  - Identify weak points in configuration.
  - Exploit built-in services.
  - Maintain and expand access within the network.

---

## Course Focus
- Windows vulnerabilities & built-in services.
- Linux vulnerabilities & popular distributions.
- Techniques that do not depend solely on typical public-facing services.
