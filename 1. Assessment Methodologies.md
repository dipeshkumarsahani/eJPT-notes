```url
http://<domain>/robots.txt
```

* Used by websites to tell search engines which pages **not to index**.
* Attackers can check this file to find **sensitive paths** or directories.
* Example output:

  ```
  User-agent: *
  Disallow: /admin/
  Disallow: /backup/
  ```

### `sitemap.xml` - Find Website Pages

```url
http://<domain>/sitemap.xml
```

* Lists important URLs used by the website.
* Helpful to discover **hidden endpoints**, **internal links**, or **admin panels**.
* Commonly used by search engines.

- SSL/TLS certificate details  
- Server technology & OS fingerprint  
- Hosting provider and IP address  
- Name servers and uptime history  
- Technologies running on the site

**Use cases for Pentesters:**
- Identify **SSL/TLS versions and certificate issues**
- Gather **network infrastructure** (IP, hosting, ASN, name servers)
- Detect outdated or **misconfigured server software**
- Discover **load balancers, firewalls, CDNs**
- Helpful in **passive reconnaissance**

**How to use:**
- Go to: [https://sitereport.netcraft.com](https://sitereport.netcraft.com)
- Enter the domain (e.g., `example.com`)

###  `dnsrecon` â€“ Command-Line DNS Enumeration

**Command:**
```bash
dnsrecon -d <domain>
````

**Description:**
`dnsrecon` is a powerful DNS enumeration tool that gathers DNS records such as:

* A, AAAA, MX, NS, SOA, TXT
* Subdomains (with brute-force if enabled)
* Zone transfers (if misconfigured)
* DNSSEC info

**Use Cases:**

* Find subdomains of a target
* Map out DNS infrastructure
* Detect misconfigured records (e.g., open zone transfers)

dnsrecon -d example.com -a       # Perform all tests
dnsrecon -d example.com -t std   # Standard enumeration only
```

ðŸ“Œ **Tip:** Combine with `whois`, `host`, `dig` for full DNS footprinting.

## `wafw00f` â€“ Web Application Firewall Detection

**Command:**
```bash
wafw00f <url>
````

**Description:**
`wafw00f` is a tool used to **detect Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)** in front of a target web application. It sends crafted HTTP requests and analyzes the responses to identify if a WAF is present and which vendor is used.
