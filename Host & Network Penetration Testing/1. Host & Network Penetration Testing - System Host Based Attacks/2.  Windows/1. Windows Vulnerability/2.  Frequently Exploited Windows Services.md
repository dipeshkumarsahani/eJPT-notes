# Frequently Exploited Windows Services

## Overview

- Windows OS has various native services and protocols that can be configured to run on a host.
- Many of these services run by default and provide attackers access vectors to gain control of the system.
- Focus is on native Microsoft services/protocols, **not third-party applications**.
- Understanding these services, how they work, and their vulnerabilities is critical for penetration testers.

## Key Windows Services and Protocols

### 1. Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services)

- **Ports:** TCP 80 (HTTP), TCP 443 (HTTPS with SSL)
- **Description:** Microsoft’s proprietary web server software for hosting websites or applications.
- **Common Use:** Hosting web applications or internal documents.
- **Vulnerabilities:** Often targeted in web application attacks.
  
### 2. WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)

- **Ports:** Same as IIS (80 or 443)
- **Description:** An HTTP extension that enables clients to update, delete, move, and copy files on a web server.
- **Common Use:** Enables file server functionality on IIS servers.
- **Vulnerabilities:** Can expose file manipulation capabilities remotely.

### 3. SMB (Server Message Block) / CIFS (Common Internet File System)

- **Port:** TCP 445 on modern Windows systems.
- **Description:** Network file sharing protocol used to share files, folders, and peripherals like printers over a LAN.
- **Common Use:** Enables Windows computers on the same network to share files and printers.
- **Note:** SMB runs on top of NetBIOS on older systems.
- **Vulnerabilities:** Frequently exploited for unauthorized file access, remote code execution, and lateral movement.

### 4. RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)

- **Port:** TCP 3389
- **Description:** Microsoft’s proprietary graphical interface for remote access and control.
- **Status:** Disabled by default but may be enabled in some systems.
- **Use:** Allows remote authentication and full control of the Windows system using valid credentials.
- **Vulnerabilities:** Can be exploited if improperly configured or if vulnerabilities exist.

### 5. WinRM (Windows Remote Management)

- **Port:** TCP 5986 (default), TCP 443 if SSL configured.
- **Description:** Protocol for remote management of Windows systems.
- **Use:** Allows remote command execution and management over the network or internet.
- **Note:** Less known but commonly found in internal enterprise networks.
- **Vulnerabilities:** Exploitable for remote command execution and system compromise.

## Summary

- These native services are common entry points for attackers.
- They may be enabled by default or found running in real-world Windows environments.
- A penetration tester must understand how to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in these services.
- Upcoming sections will cover exploitation techniques for each service in depth.
