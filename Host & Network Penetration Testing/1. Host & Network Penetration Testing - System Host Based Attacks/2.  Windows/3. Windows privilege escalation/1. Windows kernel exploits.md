## Priviledge Escalation
*   Privilege escalation is the process of exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in systems to elevate privileges from one user to another, typically to a user with administrative or root access on a system.
*   Privilege escalation is a vital element of the attack life cycle and is a major determinant in the overall success of a penetration test.
*   After gaining an initial foothold on a target system you will be required to elevate your privileges in order to perform tasks and functionality that require administrative privileges.
*   The importance of privilege escalation in the penetration testing process cannot be overstated or overlooked. Developing your privilege escalation skills will mark you out as a good penetration tester.

## Windows Kernel 
*   ### **What is a Kernel?**
    *   A **Kernel** is a computer program that serves as the core of an operating system (OS).
    *   It possesses **complete control over every resource and hardware** on a system.
    *   It functions as a **translation layer**, facilitating communication between hardware and software.

*   ### **Windows NT: Kernel and Modes of Operation**
    *   **Windows NT** is the kernel integrated with all versions of Microsoft Windows.
    *   It operates with a design philosophy that includes two main modes of operation, which dictate access to system resources and hardware:
        *   **User Mode:**
            *   This mode is for standard **programs and services**, which run with **limited access to system resources and functionality**. This design enhances system stability and security.
        *   **Kernel Mode:**
            *   This mode grants **unrestricted access to system resources and functionality**.
            *   It includes the added capability of **managing devices and system memory**, crucial for the operating system's core functions.

## Windows Kernel Exploitation

* Kernel exploits on Windows will typically target vulnerabilities in the Windows kernel to execute arbitrary code in order to run privileged system commands or to obtain a system shell.
* This process will differ based on the version of Windows being targeted and the kernel exploit being used.
* Privilege escalation on Windows systems will typically follow the following methodology:
    * Identifying kernel vulnerabilities
    * Downloading, compiling and transferring kernel exploits onto the target system.

 ## Tools & Environment
  * **Windows-Exploit-Suggester** - This tool compares a target's patch levels against the Microsoft vulnerability database in order to detect potential missing patches on the target. It also notifies the user if there are public exploits and Metasploit modules available for the missing bulletins.

### Practically

Note: A kernel exploit or privilege escalation is only possible after successfully gaining initial access to a victim's machine, typically with a low-privilege account.
