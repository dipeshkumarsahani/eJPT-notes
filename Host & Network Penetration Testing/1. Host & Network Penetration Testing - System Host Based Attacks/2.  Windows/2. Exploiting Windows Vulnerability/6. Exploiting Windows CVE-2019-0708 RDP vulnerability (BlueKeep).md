<h1>CVE-2019-0708-BlueKeep</h1>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li>
    Bluekeep (CVE-2019-0708) is the name given to an RDP vulnerability in Windows that could potentially allow attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code and gain access to a windows syatem and consequently the network that the target system is a part of.
  </li>
  <li>
    The BlueKeep vulnerability was made public by Microsoft in May 2019.
  </li>
  <li>
    The BlueKeep exploit takes advantages of a vulnerability in the windows RDP protocol that allows attackers to gain access to a chunk of kernel memory consequently allowing them to remotely execute arbitrary code at the system level without authentication.
  </li>
  <li>
    Microsoft released a patch for this vulnerability on May 14th,2019 and has urged companies to patch this vulnerability as soon as possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    At the time of discovery, about 1 million systems worldwide were found to be vulnerable.
  </li>
  <li>
    The BlueKeep vulnerability affects multiple versions of windows:
    <ul>
      <li>XP</li>
      <li>Vista</li>
      <li>Windows 7</li>
      <li>Windows Server 2008 & R2</li>
    </ul>
    
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>CVE-2019-0708-BlueKeep Exploit</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    This BlueKeep Vulnerability has various illegitimate PoC's and exploit code that could be malicious in nature. It is therefore recommended to only utilize verified exploit code and modules for exploitation.
  </li>
  <li>
    The BlueKeep exploit has an MSF auxiliary module that can be used to check if a target system if vulnerable to the exploit and also has and exploit module that can be used to exploit the vulnerability on unpatched systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    The BlueKeep exploit module can be used to exploit vulnerable Windows systems and consequently provide us with a privileged meterpreter session on the target system.
  </li>
</ul>
Note: Targeting Kernel space memory and application can cause system crashes.

<h3>Pratically</h3>
<ol>
  <li><code>nmap -p 3389 {ip}</code>></li><br>
</ol>
<hr>
<span>check target is vulnerable to this vulnerable</span>
<ol>
  <li><code>msfconsole</code></li>
  <li><code>search BlueKeep</code></li>
  <li><code>use auxiliary/scanner/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep</code></li>
  <li><code>show options</code></li>
  <li><code>set RHOSTS {ip}</code></li>
  <li><code>run</code></li>

  Now we can know that the target is vulnerable to this vulnerability or not. If vulnerable move to exploit.
