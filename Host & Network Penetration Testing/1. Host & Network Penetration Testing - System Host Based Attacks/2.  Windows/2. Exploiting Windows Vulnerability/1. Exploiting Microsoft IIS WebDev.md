## Exploiting WebDev running on Microsoft IIS

After getting target IP address, first run nmap to scan open ports and services running
```
nmap -sV -sC <ip>
```
-sV: Probe open ports to determine service/version info \
-sC: equivalent to --script=default

---

Finding more information on port 80
- we can see /webdev/ if webdev is running on that IIS microsoft server 
- Authorization is required if not asking authorization then then it is very easy to exploit it by uploading webshell

```
nmap -sV -p 80 --script=http-enum <ip>
```

---

Now, Go to the browser and then http://ip/webdev
- If authorization is required then we need to bruteforce to find out username and password.
- To bruteforce we can use ```hydra``` tool.
```
hydra -L username/wordlists/path -P password/wordlists/path <ip> http-get /webdev/
```
-L : provide username wordlists \
-P : provide password wordlists \
-p : provide username \
-l : provide password
