# System or Host-Based Attacks

## 1. Definition
- **System / Host-Based Attack**: An attack targeting a specific system or host running a specific operating system (Windows or Linux).
- Focus: Exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within the target OS.
- Contrast with **Network-Based Attacks**:  
  - Network attacks target services reachable over the network.  
  - Host-based attacks often occur **after** gaining internal access.

---

## 2. Context in Penetration Testing
- Network services are **not** the only attack vector during a penetration test.
- Host-based attacks usually happen **after gaining access to a target network**.
- Target systems could be:
  - **Servers**
  - **Workstations**
  - **Laptops**
- Often occurs inside the **internal network** where machines are not internet-facing.

## 3. Example Scenario
1. **Start**: Provided an IP to a public-facing server.
2. Server runs exploitable services (e.g., SSH, FTP, web server, MySQL).
3. Exploit one service → gain access to public-facing server.
4. Discover it’s part of an **internal network**.
5. Internal network contains multiple hosts (Windows & Linux).
6. Many hosts have **no public services** exposed — only OS-specific protocols like:
   - SMB (Windows)
   - SSH (Linux)

---

## 4. Importance of Host-Based Attacks
- Required when you encounter internal systems with **minimal services**.
- Need to understand:
  - Windows vulnerabilities & misconfigurations.
  - Linux vulnerabilities & misconfigurations.
- Knowledge enables:
  - Finding attack paths without common internet-facing services.
  - Using OS-specific weaknesses for exploitation.

---

## 5. Common Internal Targets
- **Windows**:
  - Often SMB enabled by default (file sharing, printers).
  - Multiple versions: Windows Server, Windows 10, Windows 7.
- **Linux**:
  - Internal applications, data storage, LDAP, SSH access.
  - Multiple distros: Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, etc.

---

## 6. Attack Focus Areas
1. **OS Vulnerabilities**
   - Kernel exploits.
   - Misconfigurations.
2. **Privilege Escalation**
   - Local privilege escalation techniques.
   - Impersonation attacks.
3. **Credential Attacks**
   - Dumping credentials (cleartext & hashes).
   - Preparing credentials for password cracking.
   - Using NTLM hashes for:
     - **Lateral movement**
     - **Pass-the-hash attacks**

---

## 7. Course Flow (as per lecture)
1. **Windows Section**
   - Overview of Windows vulnerabilities & misconfigurations.
   - Exploiting built-in protocols & services.
2. **Linux Section**
   - Overview of Linux vulnerabilities & misconfigurations.
   - Exploiting internal services.
3. Post-exploitation techniques:
   - Privilege escalation.
   - Credential dumping.
   - Lateral movement.

## 8. Key Takeaways
- Host-based attacks are **specialized** — require deep OS knowledge.
- They are essential when typical network services aren’t available.
- The course will provide:
  - OS vulnerability knowledge.
  - Exploitation techniques for Windows & Linux.
  - Post-exploitation skills for internal environments.
