## 🔧 Active Information Gathering – DNS Zone Transfer

## 📌 What is a DNS Zone Transfer?

A **Zone Transfer (AXFR)** is a mechanism used to replicate DNS records between DNS servers.  
If misconfigured, it allows attackers to download the full list of DNS entries — a **huge recon win**.

---

## 🛠️ Tools to Perform Zone Transfer

---

### 1. 🧭 `dnsenum`

**Command:**
```bash
dnsenum domain.com
````

**Description:**
Performs DNS enumeration and tries **zone transfers**, along with subdomain discovery and Google scraping.

📌 **Bonus:** Checks for misconfigured name servers.

---

### 2. 🧪 `dig`

**Command:**

```bash
dig @<nameserver> domain.com AXFR
```

🔁 Example:

```bash
dig @ns1.example.com example.com AXFR
```

**Description:**
Manually performs a DNS zone transfer request from a specific nameserver.

✅ If the server is misconfigured, you’ll see **all DNS records**.

---

### 3. 🐺 `fierce`

**Command:**

```bash
fierce --domain example.com
```

**Description:**
Performs DNS reconnaissance and attempts **zone transfers** and **brute-force subdomain discovery**.

📌 `fierce` is aggressive and good for fast subdomain brute-forcing.

---

## 🗂️ /etc/hosts File (Linux Internal DNS Mapping)

**Location:**

```bash
/etc/hosts
```

**Purpose:**
Maps hostnames to IP addresses **locally**.

**Example Entry:**

```bash
10.0.0.5 internal.example.com
```

🧠 Useful to:

* Add fake hostnames for testing
* Resolve internal subdomains manually during labs or simulations

---

📌 **Note:** Always try zone transfers **only on permissioned targets**. Most real-world systems will block AXFR.
