# 🛡️ Vulnerability Assessment 

## 🔍 What is Vulnerability?

A **vulnerability** is a weakness or flaw in a system, application, or configuration that an attacker can exploit to compromise **confidentiality, integrity, or availability**.

## 📘 Key Concepts

### 1. Vulnerability Overview
- **Types**:
  - Software bugs (e.g., buffer overflows)
  - Misconfigurations (e.g., open ports)
  - Outdated software
  - Default credentials

- **Impact**:
  - Unauthorized access
  - Data breaches
  - Remote code execution
  - System downtime

### 2. Vulnerability Case Study (Examples Explained in Class)

| Vulnerability Name | CVE ID | Summary |
|--------------------|--------|---------|
| **Heartbleed**     | CVE-2014-0160 | OpenSSL flaw leaking memory content |
| **EternalBlue**    | CVE-2017-0144 | SMBv1 exploit used in WannaCry ransomware |
| **Log4Shell**      | CVE-2021-44228 | RCE in Apache Log4j Java logging library |

## 📂 Vulnerability Identification Sources

### 🔐 CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
- Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities database
- Format: `CVE-YYYY-NNNN`
- Example: `CVE-2021-44228` (Log4j)

### 📖 NIST/NVD (National Vulnerability Database)
- Managed by **NIST** (U.S. government)
- Includes:
  - CVSS Score (severity)
  - Impact metrics
  - Exploitability

### 💣 Exploit-DB
- Maintained by Offensive Security
- Repository of **public exploits** and PoCs
- Website: [https://www.exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com)

## 🔧 Lab 1: Vulnerability Scanning using **Nessus**

### What is Nessus?
- Commercial vulnerability scanner
- Developed by Tenable
- Detects:
  - Missing patches
  - Configuration flaws
  - Sensitive data exposure

### Steps:
1. Launch Nessus service in browser (usually `https://localhost:8834`)
2. Create new scan:  
   - Choose **Basic Network Scan**  
   - Set **Target IP/domain**
3. Analyze Report:
   - CVEs, risk ratings (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
   - Suggested remediation

## 🧪 Lab 2: Vulnerability Research Lab

### Objective:
- Hands-on research of real CVEs using online sources

### Activities:
- Search vulnerabilities using:
  - `https://nvd.nist.gov`
  - `https://www.exploit-db.com`
  - Google Dorking or GitHub PoCs
- Study:
  - Description and severity
  - Affected systems
  - Exploit availability

### Example:
- Search `CVE-2017-0144` on NVD
- Understand exploit (`EternalBlue`)
- Research real-world attacks (e.g., WannaCry)
