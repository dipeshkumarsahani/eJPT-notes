## üî∫ CIA Triad ‚Äì Core of Cybersecurity

### 1. Confidentiality
- Only authorized users can access information.
- Follows ‚Äúfor your eyes only‚Äù principle.
- Public info = low confidentiality; secret info = high confidentiality.

### 2. Integrity
- Data should remain accurate and unchanged.
- Data sent/received or saved/retrieved must match.
- Prevents unauthorized modification.

### 3. Availability
- Information must be available when needed by authorized users.
- Even public info must be readily accessible.
- Ensures smooth operations and service delivery.

> Balancing **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability** depends on business needs.

## üß± Defense in Depth

- Multiple security layers, like medieval castles.
  - E.g., Gate ‚Üí Cameras ‚Üí Building lock ‚Üí Room lock ‚Üí File password
- Applies to both personal and organizational security.
- Reduces single points of failure.

## üè¢ Business Context

Different organizations (e.g., small business, hospital, global enterprise) have unique cybersecurity needs depending on:
- What needs to be secured  
- How it should be secured  
- Who needs access

## üìâ Risk Management

- A core principle in cybersecurity decision-making.
- Involves **cost-benefit analysis**:
  - Cost to secure vs. potential loss (breach, legal issues, data loss)
- Cybersecurity is part of overall **business risk management**.

> Even if the security team recommends strong protection, **business risk analysis** makes the final decision.
