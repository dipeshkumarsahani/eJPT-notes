# Understanding Audits in Penetration Testing

To better understand where your customer — where the company — is coming from, let's actually dive into what audits look like and what they do.

A company may be doing an audit for **compliance**. For example:

- They want to take credit card information and must comply with relevant standards.
- They’re working with the **US government** and need to meet federal compliance requirements.
- Or, they simply want to do their **due diligence** without being compelled by regulation, just to ensure security for themselves and their customers.

## What is Auditing?

Auditing helps a company check whether they are in compliance, either through internal review or a **third-party audit**.

Audits can include:

### Interviews

Interview key personnel:

- CISO, system admins, and other users who touch, create, or use sensitive information.
- Ask questions like:
  - Were you given security awareness training this year?
  - What practices do you follow?
  - Are USBs allowed?
  - Is multi-factor authentication (MFA) required to access systems/buildings?

This gives a **broad understanding** of the entire environment, not just a single viewpoint.

### Documentation & Paperwork Review

Compliance often requires:

- Keeping records in a specific way.
- Reviewing logs and documents for:
  - **Exit interview policies**
  - **Credential revocation procedures**
  - **Security incident responses**

Auditors might ask:

- Can you show documentation for past actions?
- Do you keep logs to prove compliance?

### Technical Tools

Some technical controls include:

- Firewalls
- Antivirus
- Software compliance

Tools like **Nessus scans** or **SolarWinds** can:

- Provide automated checks
- Reveal vulnerabilities or missing protections
- Give a snapshot of the current environment

## Pen Testers and Auditing

As a **penetration tester**, you can:

- Use these tools to identify issues
- Find unmitigated vulnerabilities
- Get a clearer view of the organization's weaknesses

Running a **Nessus scan** on the network being tested can be very valuable.

## Importance of Note-Taking

Pen testers should take detailed notes using tools like:

- **Joplin** – with auto-archiving
- **Sublime Text** – markdown or plaintext
- **OneNote** – collaboration and export for reports

These tools help structure findings into a clear, actionable report.

### Mind Maps

Creating a **mind map** can:

- Help structure findings visually
- Make results easier to follow for clients

## The Real Deliverable: The Report

You're not getting paid for *just* running the test — you’re getting paid for the **report**.

- This is often overlooked in training.
- Your report is what adds value to the company.
- What they do with the report is up to them, but the **clarity and utility** of the report is your responsibility.

Reports should reflect:

- Your technical expertise
- Your understanding of the business context
- Applicable regulations and compliance frameworks

## Final Thoughts

We're going to explore some auditing and pen testing tools hands-on. The goal is to:

- Understand where companies are coming from
- Combine their needs with your pen testing objectives
- Create valuable, actionable outcomes
